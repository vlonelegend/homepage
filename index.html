        <h1>Intro</h1> 
        <p>In Chapters 1,2,3 of The Psychology of the Web Developer, Maisa explains the real experiences of being a female freelancer in the web development field. One of the main ideas is that freelancing is not just about technical skills, but also about mindset, confidence, and emotional strength. Maisa shows how self-doubt and imposter syndrome can affect web developers, especially women, and how these feelings can slow down growth if not addressed.
Another important point is the challenge of balancing work, personal life, and mental health. Maisa explains that freelancing often comes with not that good of an income, client pressure, and long hours of work, which can be very stressful. She emphasizes the importance of setting boundaries and understanding your personal limits in order to avoid being burnt out.
Overall, these chapters helped me understand that web development is both a psychological and a professional journey. Success is not only measured by skills or projects, but also by how well a developer manages stress, confidence, and self-care,and their time. This reflection made me more aware of the emotional, and personal side of creative and technical work.
